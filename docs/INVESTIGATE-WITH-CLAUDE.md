# Investigate with Claude

`kbounce investigate` is a one-shot helper that lands a Claude-ready
evidence pack on disk. The operator drops both artifacts into THEIR
local Claude client (Claude Code / Cursor / desktop Claude / the
Anthropic console — whichever they use) and runs an investigative
prompt. **kbounce never calls Anthropic.** The audit data leaves
your host only if you choose to paste it.

The subcommand exists because the most useful thing a Claude agent
can do for a self-host operator is read their audit data and notice
patterns a human would miss in a thousand-row SQLite scroll.

## What the subcommand does

```
kbounce investigate [--out-dir DIR]
                    [--time-range 24h | 7d | 4w]
                    [--filter EXPR ...]
                    [--print-prompts]
                    [--db PATH] [--profiles PATH]
                    [--healthz-url URL]
```

It writes two files into `--out-dir`:

- `kbounce-investigation.ndjson` — an OCSF v1.1.0 class 2004
  (Detection Finding) wrapping the filtered audit events from the
  SQLite store. Same shape as `kbounce audit tail --export
  ocsf-bundle`. The `finding_info.desc` field records the requested
  time window + whether the audit store was populated, so a Claude
  analyst can distinguish "quiet day" from "the proxy was down".
- `kbounce-investigation-context.zip` — the standard `kbounce
  diagnostics bundle` output with `--no-audit` set (the evidence
  file already carries the audit content). Includes redacted
  config, active profile name + hash, `/healthz` snapshot, system
  metadata, and a sha256 manifest.

Then it prints a "now what" block: three of the ten starter
prompts, a one-line privacy reminder, and a pointer to this doc.

## Step-by-step workflow

```
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  1. Run: kbounce investigate --time-range 24h              |
|                                                             |
|     Output (truncated):                                     |
|       Artifacts written:                                    |
|         evidence  /tmp/.../kbounce-investigation.ndjson     |
|         context   /tmp/.../kbounce-investigation-context.zip|
+------------------------------------------------------------+
                          |
                          v
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  2. Open YOUR local Claude client.                          |
|     (Claude Code, Cursor's Claude integration, the desktop  |
|      app, or the Anthropic console — operator's choice.)    |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
                          |
                          v
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  3. Drop BOTH files into the conversation.                  |
|     (Most clients accept attachments via drag-and-drop or   |
|      a paperclip button.)                                   |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
                          |
                          v
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  4. Ask one of the starter prompts:                         |
|       "Review the past 24h of kbounce audit data.           |
|        Anything that looks off?"                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
                          |
                          v
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|  5. Iterate. The starter prompts are just openers — once    |
|     Claude has the evidence + context in scope, follow up   |
|     with whatever the first answer suggests.                |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## The ten starter prompts

Run `kbounce investigate --print-prompts` to get a paste-able copy
without writing artifact files. The list is also reproduced here so
operators reviewing the doc in a runbook context don't need to
shell out.

 1. Review the past 24h of kbounce audit data. Anything that looks
    off?
 2. Which agent generated the most denies? Was it consistent or a
    one-shot spike?
 3. Did the heartbeat gap ever exceed 60s? If yes, when + how
    often?
 4. Are there bursts of similar operations from one agent? Identify
    the actor, time window, and operation set.
 5. Did any admin-action audit event happen outside normal working
    hours? List them with timestamps.
 6. Cross-reference the rule-trigger times against the audit-export
    channel's failures (if any). Any correlation?
 7. Are there pods being deleted by an agent that historically only
    reads them? Group by agent + namespace.
 8. Which K8s namespaces appear in the most denies? Does that match
    the active profile's intent?
 9. Did the same `agent.session_id` show up across multiple kbounce
    deployments or restarts? Was that expected?
10. Summarize the most common denial reasons and what they imply
    about the currently-active profile.

Per project guidance the prompts stay generic re: Claude client —
no specific surface is named, no Cursor-vs-Codex-vs-Claude-Code
preference is implied. The operator picks the client; kbounce just
lands evidence.

## Privacy and operator-side responsibilities

`kbounce investigate` itself is strictly local:

- **No network calls** except a single LOCAL `/healthz` GET on the
  loopback port (same as `kbounce diagnostics bundle`).
- **No telemetry.** kbounce does not phone home in any way.
- **No Anthropic API call.** The subcommand never sends data to
  Anthropic. That decision is yours and happens inside YOUR Claude
  session.
- **Read-only.** The subcommand never writes to the store, the
  profiles file, or the audit log. It only creates the two
  artifacts in `--out-dir`.

What the operator should think about BEFORE pasting:

- **Your Claude session is yours.** If you use a hosted Claude
  (claude.ai, the API, Claude Code with default settings), the
  audit data goes to Anthropic the moment you upload it. That may
  or may not be acceptable in your environment. Check your data-
  classification policy first.
- **The evidence file is unredacted.** Unlike the context bundle
  (which masks tokens, hashes user IDs, scrubs URLs), the evidence
  NDJSON carries the full OCSF events verbatim. The operator chose
  the filter scope; kbounce respects that choice. Watch for K8s
  resource names, namespace names, agent identifiers — anything
  CI / production conventions consider sensitive.
- **The context bundle IS redacted** — same redactor as `kbounce
  diagnostics bundle` (webhook tokens masked, user IDs replaced
  with stable hashes, env-var keys only without values). Safe to
  share more broadly than the evidence file.
- **For air-gapped clusters**: use a local Claude (running through
  Ollama or similar) so no data leaves the host. The artifact
  shape is the same; only the client surface changes.

## Composability with other workflows

- The evidence NDJSON drops straight into a SIEM that indexes OCSF
  class 2004 (Splunk Enterprise Security, AWS Security Lake,
  Microsoft Sentinel). The Detection Finding shape lets the
  investigation surface in the SIEM's existing "open findings"
  queue without a custom parser.
- The context ZIP is the same artifact `kbounce diagnostics bundle`
  produces. If you already pipe support bundles to a ticketing
  system, the same pipeline works for investigation captures.
- For incident review: `kbounce investigate --time-range 7d
  --out-dir ./incident-2026-05-18` produces a stable, named
  directory you can attach to a post-mortem.

## Related docs

- [`docs/QUERYING-AUDIT-LOGS.md`](QUERYING-AUDIT-LOGS.md) — the
  filter grammar `--filter` shares with `kbounce audit tail`.
- [`docs/DIAGNOSTICS.md`](DIAGNOSTICS.md) — full breakdown of what
  the context-bundle ZIP contains and which fields are redacted.

## Cross-product alignment

The same `investigate` subcommand ships in `ibounce` (AWS IAM
API), `dbounce` (database connections), and `gbounce` (generic
HTTP forward proxy) with identical flags and prompt structure. An
operator running multiple bouncers learns ONE muscle-memory
pattern:

```
ibounce investigate --time-range 24h --out-dir ./ibounce-out
kbounce investigate --time-range 24h --out-dir ./kbounce-out
dbounce investigate --time-range 24h --out-dir ./dbounce-out
gbounce investigate --time-range 24h --out-dir ./gbounce-out
```

Drop all four evidence packs into one Claude session and ask
prompt 9 ("Did the same `agent.session_id` show up across multiple
products?") for cross-bouncer correlation.
